        <p>We have a growing Yoga Studio with many classes, faculty, customers, and Yoga products. We need an on-line and unified management system that will allow our customers to register for classes, our administrators to create and manage the classes, and our customers to purchase products.
            1. Our online class registration system for our Yoga studio should allow customers to enroll in one or more class for each semester. Each customer has an ID and a list of previously completed classes at our Yoga studio. When a customer attempts to enroll in a class usually they must have completed the prerequisites for that class. Our Yoga faculty teach classes and serve as advisors for our customers. Each customer has a Yoga advisor assigned to them when they attempt to enroll in their first class. The advisor will be able to waive the prerequisite requirement for a customer if they think the customerâ€™s request for a waiver is reasonable. Requests for waivers can be submitted online to the advisor with the reason for the request. Advisors approve or reject waiver requests online to allow the customers to continue with their class registration.
            2. Our administrators should be able to add, delete, and edit Yoga classes. Classes could have multiple offerings in a semester. Each class has a customer number limit and is filled on a first come, first serve basis. When the class is filled, customers may ask to be put on a waiting list for that class..
             3. We have a catalog of Yoga related products. Our customers should be able to purchase them on-line</p>
